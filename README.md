# Library

Brief reflection on this project:

1. Javascript is my first programming language and I'm finding ES6 classes really handy.
I know a large chunk of developers probably think they are 'syntactic sugar' but for someone like me
that don't have experience with a real OOP language I find them useful.

2. Storing JavaScript objects as JSON strings in the window.localStorage object.
Whenever you add a book to the library the data of it will be kept on your machine until you manually
delete it via the site's functionality.

3. This project has actually tipped my scales towards learning back-end development first.
Traversing the DOM, creating divs and classes, handling clicks, presses, mousedowns and just basically doing event-based coding that's bound to the interface of a website has gradually started to put me off.
